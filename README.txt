Include a README.txt file to justify why your project is worth 100 points. What CSS3 features did you use? Did you use any cool JavaScript libraries? What nifty features of your program were a bear to implement?

Justify why the project is worth 100 points:

We spent a long time on the styling to make the page look visually appealing,
we constructed a game that meets all of our proposals needs,
we met all of the requirements for the assignment, and we added CSS3
features and added the HIGHSCORE API.

The 3 CSS3 features that we used:

  We used RGBA colors for our green background image with an opacity of 0.65 for
  our footer

  We used a linear gradient to the right from light green to green for our header

  We used a shadow effect that displays a white shadow under the h1 text

  Made an animated snake with the animation css3 feature using 4 different divs


Cool Javascript libraries:


Features that were difficult to implement:
